# ML Studio Package
A Shiny platform for ML applications (under construction). Available features:
1. Data Management -
  - Ability to load data from installed R package, R environment and/or csv file
  - Modify variable attribution
2. Interactive data visualization tool with the Plotly package, that include:
- Scatter, line, histogram correlation, etc.
- Time series plots – seasonality, correlation etc.
3. Machine learning with the H2O package, currently only classification models available (Random Forest, GBM, GLM)

Features under construction:
-	Machine learning:

o	Deep learning models with H2O and Keras

o	Regression models

o	The caret training function and models

o	H2O Grid search

o	Unsupervised learning

o	Time series and forecasting 

-	Data manipulation tools – summary tables, sampling etc.
-	Data visualization – extending the current functionality
